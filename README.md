You can add any sort of apps and it will record your 'playtime' (how long you have the app open for). Like steam, etc.

Here is the UI:
==============================
Options:
1. See all available apps
2. Add new app
3. Play an app
4. Check playtime
5. Delete app
6. Exit
==============================

As an example, if you want to add a new app, you can do add new app and name it.
Lets say you name it vsc

Then you need to add a .lnk file in the shortcuts folder and make sure it has the same name as the one you added in the "add new app" option.
So in this case you rename the lnk file to vsc

Scuffed Stuff:
- Make sure there aren't spaces/special characters. (there are no checks for this so its kind ascuffed)
- You need to have the same exact .lnk file name as the one you input in 'add new app' 
- You have to manually add .lnk file
